## Encouragement to Fork and Customize

This Drawer Count App was built to be easily adaptable for various business
needs. You are strongly encouraged to:

• Fork this repository and customize it for your specific requirements
• Modify the calculator logic for different types of counting scenarios
• Add new features that benefit your workflow
• Integrate with your existing business systems
• Share improvements back to the community (though not required)

The codebase uses modern web standards (Web Components, ES6 modules) and
is designed to be maintainable and extensible. Feel free to use this as
a foundation for your own point-of-sale tools, inventory systems, or any
other counting applications.

If you create something interesting based on this project, I'd love to
hear about it! You can reach out via GitHub issues or discussions.

Happy coding!
