## v0.1.5 - 2025-09-20
### Added
- Install banner that offers Install (when supported) or Open in App once installed; persists dismissal and supports iOS ‚Äúhow to install‚Äù guidance.
- Service Worker message channel to focus an existing client window (OPEN_APP), used by the banner‚Äôs Open in App action.

### Changed
- Service worker cache bumped to `v17`; improved scope-aware precache and navigation fallbacks for subpath deployments.
- Always bypass cache for `/config.js` and all `/api/*` requests; SW now broadcasts connectivity changes to clients.
- Title shows a subtle "‚Ä¢ Offline" suffix when offline.

### Docs
- README: correct Quick Start (remove non-existent `dev:static` script), update SW cache version reference to `v17`, and document the Install/Open-in-App flow.
 - Correct API base URL references to use `https://drawer-count-app.onrender.com/api` (replacing previous `*.onrender.app` examples). Also updated the production default fallback URL in docs.

## v0.1.4 - 2025-09-20
### Added
- Collapsible Count Panel wrapper around the drawer component with a Show/Hide toggle; state persists per profile/day.
- Manifest enhancements: `launch_handler: { client_mode: "focus-existing" }` and `capture_links: "existing-client-nav"` for better installed-app behavior.

### UI
- Background image fade-in refined and overlay contrast tuned for light/dark themes.
- Minor accessibility and keyboard interaction polish across header actions and modals.

## v0.1.3 - 2025-09-20
### Changed
- Server status is now displayed inside the same bottom-right network status pill as a small badge (icon + short code).
- Removed the separate server status pill from the header and the temporary floating server pill.

### UI
- The combined pill updates every 20s and on online/offline events. Badge codes: `OK`, `NODB`, `ERR`, `OFF`, and `N/A`.

## v0.1.2 - 2025-09-20
### Added
- Server supports configurable MongoDB TLS via env vars: `MONGODB_TLS`, `MONGODB_TLS_INSECURE`, and optional CA inputs (`MONGODB_TLS_CA_FILE`, `MONGODB_TLS_CA_PEM`, `MONGODB_TLS_CA_BASE64`).
- `.env.example` with local and Render/Atlas-friendly defaults.
- README: new sections for Render + Atlas deployment and a quick deploy checklist.

### Fixed
- Avoid TLS handshake failures on providers that require explicit TLS flags by allowing configuration via env vars.

## v0.1.1 - 2025-09-20
### Added
- Backend runtime config endpoint: `GET /config.js` exposes `window.DCA_API_BASE` derived from the `API_BASE` environment variable.
- Client-side API base resolution: app now reads `window.DCA_API_BASE`, optional `localStorage['dca.apiBase']`, and defaults to `'/api'`.
 - Production default: when not on localhost, the app falls back to `https://drawer-count-app.onrender.com/api` unless overridden.

### Changed
- Backend storage is now global/shared across all clients (no `X-Client-Id` needed). Legacy per-client records are still read if a global value is missing.
- Frontend sync switched to the new global scope and uses `apiUrl()` for all requests (`/health`, `/kv/:key`).

### PWA
- Service worker always bypasses caching for `/api/*` requests and for `/config.js`; returns JSON `503` when offline.

### Docs
- README updated with environment-based `API_BASE` config (works with Render), global/shared data behavior, and SW caching notes.

## v0.0.11 - 2025-09-20
### Added
- Random background image chosen from `src/images/` on load.
- Smooth fade-in animation for background image via a dedicated background layer.

### Performance
- Image optimization pipeline using `sharp`: recompress PNGs (preserve alpha) and generate `.webp` variants with transparency.
- Runtime prefers `.webp` when supported, falls back to optimized `.png`.

### PWA
- Bump service worker cache version to `v10` and precache both `.png` and `.webp` background assets for offline use.

### Scripts & Docs
- New `npm run optimize-images` script and docs for adding/optimizing background images.
- `predeploy` now runs `bump-sw` and `optimize-images`.

## v0.0.10 - 2025-09-20
- Adds a background image and transluceny to UI so that it remains visible.
## v0.0.9 - 2025-09-20
### Added
- Optional Daily Fields modal (üßæ button in header) for entering: Charges, Total Received, Net Sales, Gross Profit Amount ($), Gross Profit Percentage (%), Number of Invoices, Number of Voids.
- Optional values are saved per day and included in profiles/export but do not affect totals or balance.

### Changed
- Drawer state upgraded to version 2 with a new `optional` section; backward-compatible with normalization when comparing saved/unsaved status.
- Inline optional section is now hidden in `DrawerCount` (kept for state hydration and autosave hooks).
- Header UI updated with Optional Fields button; disabled when viewing locked (read-only) days.

### Fixed
- Prevent false "Unsaved changes" indicator by normalizing state (ignoring timestamps and defaulting missing optional fields) when computing header status.

### PWA
- Bump service worker cache version to `v9` to ensure clients fetch updated assets.
