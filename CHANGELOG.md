# Changelog

## v0.0.10 - 2025-09-20
- Adds a background image and transluceny to UI so that it remains visible.
## v0.0.9 - 2025-09-20
### Added
- Optional Daily Fields modal (ðŸ§¾ button in header) for entering: Charges, Total Received, Net Sales, Gross Profit Amount ($), Gross Profit Percentage (%), Number of Invoices, Number of Voids.
- Optional values are saved per day and included in profiles/export but do not affect totals or balance.

### Changed
- Drawer state upgraded to version 2 with a new `optional` section; backward-compatible with normalization when comparing saved/unsaved status.
- Inline optional section is now hidden in `DrawerCount` (kept for state hydration and autosave hooks).
- Header UI updated with Optional Fields button; disabled when viewing locked (read-only) days.

### Fixed
- Prevent false "Unsaved changes" indicator by normalizing state (ignoring timestamps and defaulting missing optional fields) when computing header status.

### PWA
- Bump service worker cache version to `v9` to ensure clients fetch updated assets.
